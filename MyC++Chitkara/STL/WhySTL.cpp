    //Algoritms->Sorting,binarySearch,these are the algorithms.
    //iterators->wo object hai jo containers ke element ki taraf point karte hai it will be handled like pointers.
    //connect algo and container object that point to element of container

    //There are three types of container->
    //1.Sequence  1->2->3->4 (Sequencial) Linear way (vector,list)
    //2.Associative   (tree)  it consume less time  set,multiset,map,multimap
    //3.Derived       it can be derived by sequence or Associative  (Stack,Queue) Stack->LIFO,   QUEUE->FIFO


    //If you want to insert at middle then use list otherwise you should use vector because random acess is fast at vector.
    //If you do not want random access then you can use associative
